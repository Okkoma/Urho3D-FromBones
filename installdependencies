# Urho3D library : Building prerequisites

# Although all required third-party libraries are included as source code, there are system-level dependencies that must be satisfied before Urho3D can be built successfully:

# For Windows, the June 2010 DirectX SDK needs to be installed. This is not necessary if building on Visual Studio 2012 or newer, which install the Windows SDK with the necessary DirectX files.
# For Linux, install one or more of the development packages from each software component category below. Building as 32-bit on a 64-bit system requires installing also the 32-bit versions of the development libraries.
#     Database server (optional). Disabled by default even when the development package is installed, use URHO3D_DATABASE_ODBC=1 to enable. The two packages below are mutually exclusive. The ODBC driver manager is the recommended package.
#         libiodbc2-dev (Debian-based) or libiodbc-devel (RedHat-based) for iODBC driver manager.
#         unixodbc-dev (Debian-based) or unixODBC-devel (RedHat-based) for ODBC driver manager.
#     Display server (essential). One or more of these can be installed at the same time. When multiple display servers are available, X11 takes precedence (overridable using SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment variable during application runtime).
#         libdirectfb-dev (Debian-based only) for Direct Frame Buffer (DirectFB). Disabled by default even when installed, use VIDEO_DIRECTFB=1 to enable.
#         libegl1-mesa-dev, libwayland-dev, and wayland-protocols (Debian-based) or libwayland-client-devel, libwayland-cursor-devel, libxkbcommon-devel, mesa-libEGL-devel, mesa-libwayland-egl-devel, and wayland-protocols-devel (RedHat-based) for Wayland.
#         libx11-dev, libxcursor-dev, libxext-dev, libxi-dev, libxinerama-dev, libxrandr-dev, libxrender-dev, libxss-dev, and libxxf86vm-dev (Debian-based) or libX11-devel, libXcursor-devel, libXext-devel, libXi-devel, libXinerama-devel, libXrandr-devel, libXrender-devel, libXScrnSaver-devel, and libXxf86vm-devel (RedHat-based)
#          => for X11 and its extensions. Alternatively, you can use xorg-devel meta package on Debian-based system, but it would install other unneeded packages as well.
#     Sound server (essential). One or more of these can be installed at the same time. When multiple sound servers are available, PulseAudio takes precedence (overridable using SDL_AUDIODRIVER environment variable during application runtime).
#         libasound2-dev (Debian-based) or alsa-lib-devel (RedHat-based) for Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA).
#         arts-devel (RedHat-based only) for Analog Real Time Synthesizer (aRts).
#         libaudio-dev (Debian-based only) for Network Audio System (NAS).
#         libesd0-dev (Debian-based) or esound-devel (RedHat-based) for Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESounD).
#         libfusionsound-dev (Debian-based only, not available on Ubuntu) for FusionSound. Disabled by default even when installed, use FUSIONSOUND=1 to enable.
#         libpulse-dev (Debian-based) or pulseaudio-libs-devel (RedHat-based) for PulseAudio.
#         libroar-dev (Debian-based only) for RoarAudio (SNDIO).
#     Input method editor (optional). One or both of these can be installed at the same time to enable the IME support in the game engine. When both frameworks are installed on user's host system, the application uses XMODIFIFIERS environment variable to determine which one is active.
#         libibus-1.0-dev (Debian-based) or ibus-devel (RedHat-based) for Intelligent Input Bus (ibus).
#         fcitx-libs-dev (Debian-based) or fcitx-devel (RedHat-based) for Flexible Input Method Framework (fcitx).
#     Miscellaneous (optional).
#         libdbus-1-dev (Debian-based) or dbus-devel (Redhat-based) for system-wide messaging (e.g. inhibiting screen-saver).
#         libreadline6-dev (Debian-based) or readline-devel (Redhat-based) for easy editing of command lines in interactive standalone host tools, e.g. isql and lua interpreter.
#         libts-dev (Debian-based) or tslib-devel (RedHat-based) for resistive, single-touch touchscreen input for embedded Linux device, e.g. Pandora and Wiz. Modern multi-touch touchscreen does not need this.
#         libudev-dev (Debian-based) or systemd-devel (Redhat-based) for input device hot-plugging.
#     HTTPS support (optional).
#         libssl-dev (Debian-based)
#         openssl (OS X using homebrew)
# For Raspberry Pi, follow the building prerequisite for Linux above, with the exception for display server. Raspberry Pi operating system usually already comes with Broadcom Video Core display server preinstalled. On top of that, you must also install this package: libevdev2 (Raspbian) or libevdev (Pidora).
# For macOS, iOS, and tvOS, the Xcode developer tools package should include everything necessary. Make sure that the Xcode command line tools are also installed. Homebrew is required to install 'cmake' and some of the optional development packages, such as ccache, doxygen, graphviz, and readline.
# For Android, the Android Studio (version 4.0 or later) should include everything necessary. Make sure the Android NDK r21d is installed with the Android SDK Manager and CMake version 3.17.3 is installed on the host machine. Adjust the "buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/UrhoCommon.kt" accordingly if your host has different NDK and CMake version.
# For Web, the Emscripten SDK (version 1.39.0 or later) needs to be installed with the upstream LLVM WASM backend is activated. On Windows host also MinGW-W64 compiler toolchain is required.
